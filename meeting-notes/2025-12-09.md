# 1. Alt HS WG Meetup 2025-12-09

## Goal:

Help decentralization of Matrix and new Users to find a homeserver other than matrix.org

## Steps:

1. ✅ Sync initial interested people
1. Contact people
    1. @austin:tchncs.de == joinmatrix.org
    2. @aine:etke.cc == https://matrixrooms.info
3. Once the group is fixed, make an [official working group](https://matrix.org/foundation/governing-board/bylaws/04-processes/#working-group-creation-process)
    4. Write in the [#governing-board-office:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/%23governing-board-office:matrix.org)
5. Do the actual work
    3. Work out policy
6. Once we have the policy and governance
    1. Have an API (or IPFS, or Staticfile, or Git Repo, or part of the website, or Debian Mirror)
    2. Have it integrated on matrix.org
    3. Integrate it into matrix clients
7. Work out other means of decentralization
    1. Help local associations to create community based servers
    1. Account portability

## Output of the initial phase of the Working Group

- How do you end up on the server list (Policy)
- Process on how to apply to the list and who approves it

## Administrative

- How do we work together
	- ~~Simple markdown file~~
	- [Hegedoc (this thing)](https://md.coredump.ch/AdXu3e2VQTeElZQWZH0FnQ) (for now)

## Ideas for Policy

- Starting points:
    - https://matrixrooms.info/indexing & https://matrixrooms.info/indexing-room
    - https://servers.joinmatrix.org/operators.html
        - (Actually I used to scan https://wiki.asra.gr/en:public_servers for public servers, usually I try to figure out who the admin is, ask them to either close it if it's not intended to be open reg, and ask them if they want to join if they are intended to the general public. Not mentioned in the documentation is a 1-month waiting period to prevent throwaway servers, though the problem still persists that running a public server is just not appealing for many.)
- Have ping stats of servers
    - JoinMatrix.org starting point: https://codeberg.org/austinhuang/matrix-serverlist-react/src/branch/main/pinger.js; but things like room count may require a setup that actually imitates a homeserver
- Have Federation stats
    - Once we have concrete policy, contact [#ping:maunium.net](https://matrix.to/#/#ping:maunium.net)
- Version up to date (JoinMatrix.org also checks for this)
- Admins/Mods
    - Are they known
    - Do they regularly talk to people
    - General Profile (who is mod team, links to mastodon, blog, github whatever)

## Next Steps

- [x] Clement will contact the joinmatrix.org guy: [@austin:tchncs.de](https://matrix.to/#/@austin:tchncs.de)
- [x] Clement will contact [@aine:etke.cc](https://matrix.to/#/@aine:etke.cc)
- [x] TBD will contact [@sky:codestorm.net](https://matrix.to/#/@sky:codestorm.net)
- [x] TBD will contact [@cat:feline.support](https://matrix.to/#/@cat:feline.support)
- [x] TBD will contact [@tulir:maunium.net](https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net)

## Text to reach out

Preferably ping ppl you would like to involve in a public room prior sending them "a random DM". That's easier to give them a little context and avoid the confusion of starting a DM out of the blue.

Hi there

We are in the process of creating a Matrix Foundation working group (https://matrix.org/foundation/governing-board/bylaws/04-processes/#working-group-creation-process) to promote decentralization for matrix homeservers.

We had some ideas and one of our first steps would probably be to help people to find their cozy homeserver (which would not be matrix.org).

We contact you because we saw that you already started something going into this direction. Would you like to join us in this great journey?

If you're interested, you can find our latest meeting's minutes here and our ruff planning steps: https://md.coredump.ch/s/M-eF88l0P

Looking forward to hearing from you.
