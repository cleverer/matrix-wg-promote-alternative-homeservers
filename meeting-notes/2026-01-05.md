## Charter

The Working Group aims to promote decentralization of the Matrix network and help new users to find a homeserver other than matrix.org. Specifically it tries to foster a smoother onboarding experience (to homeservers and clients) on homeservers other than matrix.org and might propose additional measure in the ecosystem as a whole.

Our WG outcome would likely include a technical solution to choose a public homeserver, a default foundation "trusted" server list with an inclusion and removal process of such servers from the Foundation "trusted" list. This include a clear and public policy on how to join the "trusted" server list.

The WG also sees itself responsible to maintain the Foundation "trusted" public homeserver list.
