# Matrix WG - Promote Alternative Homeservers

This repository contains all documents and notes of the Matrix Working Group (WG) focused on promoting alternative Homeservers within the Matrix ecosystem.

> [!WARNING]  
> This Working Group is currently in the proposal phase and has not yet been officially established. The location and name of this repository may change once the WG is formally created.

## Charta

> [!NOTE]  
> This charta is not final yet and this is just a draft version for discussion.

> The Working Group aims to promote decentralization of the Matrix network and help new users to find a homeserver other than matrix.org. Specifically it tries to foster a smoother onboarding experience (to homeservers and clients) on homeservers other than matrix.org and might propose additional measure in the ecosystem as a whole.
>
> Our WG outcome would likely include a technical solution to choose a public homeserver, a default foundation “trusted” server list with an inclusion and removal process of such servers from the Foundation “trusted” list. This include a clear and public policy on how to join the “trusted” server list.
>
> The WG also sees itself responsible to maintain the Foundation “trusted” public homeserver list.

## Working mode

The WG will hold regular meetings (every first monday of the month at 18:00 CET) to discuss progress, challenges, and next steps. Meeting notes will be documented and stored in this repository.

If you wanna get involved or join a meeting, feel free to join the [#alternative-homeservers:exma.de](https://matrix.to/#/%23alternative-homeservers:exma.de) room.

## Out of Scope

The WG will not focus on the technical development of homeservers themselves, but rather on the onboarding experience and the ecosystem as a whole.

Additionally, the WG does not currently aim to assist in starting your own homeserver, but rather to promote existing alternative homeservers. See the "Other Useful Resources" section below for links that may help you in starting your own homeserver.
